 Calling this script install-sh is preferred over install.sh, to prevent
 `make' implicit rules from creating a file called install from it
 when there is no Makefile.
 .
 This script is compatible with the BSD install script, but was written
 from scratch.  It can only install one file at a time, a restriction
 shared with many OS's install programs.
 .
 set DOITPROG to echo to test this script
 .
 Don't use :- since 4.3BSD and earlier shells don't like it.
